year and for that it go through online classes in Coursera where i achieve a lot of knowledge according to Robotic, and according to the problem that my country phases i decide to think at 
which way can i contribute to help my country according to that. After so mamy days & mounth i didn't get anything, one day after the failling of terrorists against my country army at Djibo
;where terrorist have decided to attack this village at the time of recharging and maintenance of the drones,but their plane fail and this idea come to my mind why not built the drone who 
can recharge himself and give the full maintenance needed by this drone. This is where appear the idea of CAROS-Self-Power.This project contains Robotics ,Power-system,IOT,Control system
